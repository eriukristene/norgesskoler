Fustat, meaning ‘city of tents,’ was eventually absorbed into Cairo (today, the area is part of Old Cairo). The mosque saw considerable development in the years to come, including a doubling of its size in 673 CE; it was built to its present-day size in 827 CE.

It replaced the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As, which could not fit all of Ibn Tulun’s soldiers, as the main congregational mosque. The mosque is the only structure to have survived the razing of al-Qata’i in the 10th century CE when power shifted to the Abbasids.
