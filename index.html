They completed this mosque at its centre in 642 CE on the site of the tent of the commander of the conquering army, General Amr ibn al-As, and made it large enough to serve as the main site of congregation for his army. Fustat, meaning ‘city of tents,’ was eventually absorbed into Cairo (today, the area is part of Old Cairo). The mosque saw considerable development in the years to come, including a doubling of its size in 673 CE; it was built to its present-day size in 827 CE. However, owing to its dilapidation the mosque was destroyed and rebuilt in the 18th century CE – and was rebuilt again in 1875.

It replaced the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As, which could not fit all of Ibn Tulun’s soldiers, as the main congregational mosque. The mosque is the only structure to have survived the razing of al-Qata’i in the 10th century CE when power shifted to the Abbasids.
